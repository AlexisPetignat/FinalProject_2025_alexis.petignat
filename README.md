Recommender System final project. Thou shall disover the mighty system one has built.

# Introduction

Behold! This is the Final Project for the Recommender System – the grand culmination of humanity’s technological dabblings (at least until tea time). With great pomp, ceremony, and possibly a duck, we present a marvel of modern computing: a system designed to divine which N videos a user might fancy – all based on the sacred scrolls of the KuaiRec dataset.

Now, before you lob tomatoes or shout "Ni!", a humble request: do bear in mind that we are but simple folk, valiantly juggling multiple quests (some involving dragons, deadlines, and dubious dietary choices). The time bestowed upon this endeavour was shorter than a hedgehog’s temper – so be gentle, or we shall be forced to release... the comments section.
